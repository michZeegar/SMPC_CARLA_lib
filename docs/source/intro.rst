This documentation goes into detail on how to use an MPC control structure for controlling vehicle in CARLA. 
It starts by showing how to start a CARLA server with scripts. 
Later, the MPC control design framework will be explained based on the example script ‘simpleCar_MPC2.py.’ 
Furthermore, the limitations and known problems will be outlined. 
In the end, an auto-documentation of the single functions of the MPC is presented.
